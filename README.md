## Notes

One challenge I faced while building the app was making the reset button work properly. Initially, the button appeared, but it didn’t actually reset the field, which was frustrating. After reviewing my code and adjusting some of the commands controlling the button’s behavior, I was able to make it function correctly. This not only improved the app’s usability but also gave me confidence in troubleshooting UI issues.
Another challenge was getting my source code to appear on GitHub. At first, only the README file was visible in my repository, which was confusing. By carefully reading the Git command documentation, I learned how to manually push my commits through the terminal. Once I did this, all my source files appeared correctly in the repo, allowing me to successfully share my project online and maintain proper version control. Overcoming these challenges strengthened both my coding and problem-solving skills.
